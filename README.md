Description
The "Songwriter" website is designed for guitar players who want to share their favorite tabs with others. This app is especially useful for those who have struggled to write tabs in a standard notepad or text editor. Users can create, view, update, and request guitar tabs using a notation editor with functionality.

<a name="Author"></a>About the Author
I am a web developer and musician based in Los Angeles. I have always been excited by the way technology can be used to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives. At the same time, I have a deep passion for music - particularly the guitar - and have been playing and studying the instrument for many years. The Songwriter app is a reflection of this passion for music and technology.
